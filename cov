This patch series adds the support for RISC-V ISA extension smcntrpmf (cycle and
privilege mode filtering) [1]. It is based on Kevin's earlier work but improves
it by actually implement privilege mode filtering by tracking the privilege
mode switches. This enables the privilege mode filtering for mhpmcounters as
well. However, Smcntrpmf/Sscofpmf must be enabled to leverage this. This series
also modified to report the raw instruction count instead of virtual cpu time
based on the instruction count when icount is enabled. The former seems to be
the preferred approach for instruction count for other architectures as well.

Please let me know if anybody thinks that's incorrect.
